## TEI ODD Schema Customizations

Schwartz, Daniel L. “Encoding Manual and TEI Customization for SPEAR: Syriaca Persons, Events, and Relations” Second Edition. Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Portal. 2019-2025. [https://github.com/srophe/spear/blob/main/documentation/Schema/SPEAR.odd](https://github.com/srophe/spear/blob/main/documentation/Schema/SPEAR.odd). HTML: [https://spear-prosop.org/documentation/Schema/SPEAR.html](https://spear-prosop.org/documentation/Schema/SPEAR.html). 
> Prose description of guidelines for encoding SPEAR factoid prosopography data. TEI ODD schema customization that constrains the use of the TEI for encoding factoids and integrating them with the Syriaca.org knowledge graph.

Schwartz, Daniel L. “TEI Customization for the Srophé Application.” Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Portal. 2019-2025. [https://github.com/srophe/Gaddel/blob/main/documentation/schemas/srophe.odd](https://github.com/srophe/Gaddel/blob/main/documentation/schemas/srophe.odd). 
> A TEI ODD schema customization for use by any project employing the Srophé Application or the Gaddel Application. This offers a minimal customization of the TEI P5 schema and serves as the first layer of Syriaca.org’s chain of TEI ODD customizations. No project currently uses this layer of the chained ODD for document validation but it is an essential component of Syriaca.org’s documentation and data integrity. 

Schwartz, Daniel L. “TEI Customization for Syriaca.org.” Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Portal. 2019-2025. [https://github.com/srophe/Gaddel/blob/main/documentation/schemas/syriacaAll.odd](https://github.com/srophe/Gaddel/blob/main/documentation/schemas/syriacaAll.odd). 
> A TEI ODD schema customization layer for Syriaca.org’s chained ODDs. This ODD uses the “TEI Customization for the Srophé Application” layer as its starting point and customizes it with the portions of the TEI that are common to all Syriaca.org authority file projects. No project currently uses this layer of the chained ODD for validation but it is an essential component of Syriaca.org’s documentation and data integrity. It allows Syriaca.org to maintain the portions of the TEI ODD customization common to all authority file projects in one location. This ODD forms the basis of the other ODDs against which specific publication files are validated.

Schwartz, Daniel L. “TEI Customization for Syriaca.org Persons Data.” Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Portal.2019- 2025. [https://github.com/srophe/Gaddel/blob/main/documentation/schemas/syriacaPersons.odd](https://github.com/srophe/Gaddel/blob/main/documentation/schemas/syriacaPersons.odd). 
> A TEI ODD schema customization layer for Syriaca.org’s person data. This ODD uses the “TEI Customization for Syriaca.org” ODD as its starting point and customizes the Syriaca.org schema for validating person data. This ODD allows us to produce the final RelaxNG file against which Syriaca.org validates the XML files in the Syriac Biographical Dictionary.

Schwartz, Daniel L. “TEI Customization for Syriaca.org Place Data.” Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Portal. 2019-2025. [https://github.com/srophe/Gaddel/blob/main/documentation/schemas/syriacaPlaces.odd](https://github.com/srophe/Gaddel/blob/main/documentation/schemas/syriacaPlaces.odd). 
> A TEI ODD schema customization layer for Syriaca.org’s place data. This ODD uses the “TEI Customization for Syriaca.org” ODD as its starting point and customizes the Syriaca.org schema for validating places data. This ODD allows us to produce the final RelaxNG file against which Syriaca.org validates the XML files in the The Syriac Gazetteer.

Michelson, David A., William L. Potter, and Daniel L. Schwartz. “Syriac Manuscripts in the British Library: TEI P5 Customization and Encoding Guidelines for Manuscript Description.” Syriaca.org: The Syriac Reference Portal. 2024. [https://github.com/srophe/britishLibrary/blob/main/documentation/schema/Syriacamsdesc.odd](https://github.com/srophe/britishLibrary/blob/main/documentation/schema/Syriacamsdesc.odd). 
> This TEI ODD schema customization constrains the TEI P5 schema for describing manuscript data in “Syriac Manuscripts in the British Library: A New Digital Edition of Wright’s Catalogue.” It is based on those published by the Bodleian Library, Oxford and James Cummings as “TEI P5 Customization and Encoding Guidelines for Manuscript Description,” licenced under CC BY 4.0. In turn, the work of the Bodleian Library, Oxford and James Cummings was based on the medieval manuscript guidelines written by James Freeman and Matthew Holford and encoded by Matthew Holford.
