## Short Bio
I am an Associate Professor of History. My research lies at the intersection of Roman History, 
History of Religion, Digital Humanities, and Cultural Heritage Informatics with a particular focus on the 
literature and culture in the Syriac language. Syriac is a dialect of Aramaic that flourished in the Middle 
East from the third to the ninth centuries C.E. and continues to be used by communities throughout the Middle 
East and India today. 

I direct [Syriaca.org](http://syriaca.org), a linked-open data project 
dedicated to advancing scholarship in the field of Syriac Studies and to preserving Syriac cultural 
heritage. I am also the general editor of SPEAR: Syriac Persons, Events, and Relations (forthcoming), 
an online prosopographical research tool; and the co-editor (with Sergey Minov) of the forthcoming Syriac Taxonomy 
([Beta release](https://d2iy9xuv4su69v.cloudfront.net/taxonomy/index.html)), a SKOS taxonomy for Syriac Studies. As 
part of my current NEH-funded work I am producing an OER (Open Educational Resource) corpus of Syriac source material
in English translation. These TEI encoded texts will be integrated into the Syriaca.org knowledge graph through 
the markup of persons, places, works, and keyword concepts.

I am also the author of 
_[Paideia and Cult: Christian Initiation in Theodore of Mopsuestia](https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/display/5813.daniel-l-schwartz-paideia-and-cult-christian-initiation-in-theodore-of-mopsuestia)_ 
and the co-editor (with Arietta Papaconstantinou and Neil McLynn) of _Conversion in Late Antiquity: Christianity, Islam, and Beyond_. 
I have published articles and book chapters on Digital History, religious conversion, and religious violence in Late Antiquity.
